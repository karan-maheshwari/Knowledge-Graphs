Run "Karan_Maheshwari_task1.py filename1.csv filename2.csv" to create an intermediate file called "similarities.txt" (in the same directory) that contains the distance measures between the pairs.

Run "Karan_Maheshwari_task2.py". This automatically takes the "similarities.txt" (should be present in the same directory) as input and outputs a file called "output.txt" in the same directory.
